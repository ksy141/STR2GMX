Build CHARMM-GUI-style topology files to run GROMACS simulations
STR2GMX uses a whole structure to build topology files. 
There should be no missing atoms.
Systems containing protieins are not currently supported.
[Will be updated in a near future.]

STR2GMX was written based on psf2itp.py, which was written by
Jumin Lee [jul316@lehigh.edu] and Wonpil Im [wonpil@lehigh.edu].

While psf2itp.py reads a psf file and CHARMM parameter files 
to build GROMACS topology files,
STR2GMX reads a whole structure and both CHARMM parameter and topology files.

You can also easily solvate systems with Solvate class.
Addition of ions will be supported in a near future.
